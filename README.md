# Hugbomb

Sometimes, the interwebs can feel like a mean place. But then there's that one comment, post, reply, or video that makes you proud to be a web-izen again.

For those moments, I created hugbomb. Derived from "prop bombing" on Fitocracy, hugbombing is the delicate and oft-neglected art of surprising those who commit an act of digital kindness with gratitude (and a fairly large amount of web fame).

## Rules of Engagement

1. A proposed target for hugbombing should be a genuine act of gratitude that deserves to be recognized, not a piece of content that you think deserves more attention (there are way, way too many sites for that). No fanboy/fangirl wars, no political/religious/ideological debates. Just universally-understood acts of kindness. A good rule of thumb: if you have to make a case for something deserving to be hugbombed, it doesn't deserve to be hugbombed.
2. Hugbombing should be done with a passion, but limited by the extent of the law. (TL;DR no illegal activities plz)
3. The community of hugbombers are trusting. Don't break that trust. (TL;DR I don't wanna bother with a system for reporting people who constantly propose unworthy hugbombing targets, or worse, use hugbomb as a hate-spewing machine to threaten or actually do horrible things to people.)

Ready the hugbombs!
